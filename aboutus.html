   <h1>About the company </h1>
   <p>RCA began videodisc research in 1964, in an attempt to produce a phonograph-like method of reproducing video under the name 'Discpix'. Research and development was slow in the early years, as the development team originally comprised only four men, but by 1972, the CED team at RCA had produced a disc capable of holding ten minutes of color video (a portion of the Get Smart episode "A Tale of Two Tails", re-titled "Lum Fong").<br><br>

    The first CED prototype discs were multi-layered, consisting of a vinyl substrate, nickel conductive layer, glow-discharge insulating layer and silicone lubricant top layer. Failure to fully solve the stylus/disc wear and manufacturing complexity forced RCA to seek simpler construction of the disc. The final disc was crafted using PVC blended with carbon to make the disc conductive. To preserve stylus and groove life, a thin layer of silicone was applied to the disc as a lubricant.<br><br>

     CED videodiscs were originally conceived as being housed in jackets and handled by hand similar to LP records, but during testing it was shown that exposure to dust caused skipped grooves. If dust was allowed to settle on the discs, the dust would absorb moisture from the air and cement the dust particle to the disc surface, causing the stylus to jump back in a locked groove situation. Thus, an idea was developed in which the disc would be stored and handled in a plastic caddy from which the CED would be extracted by the player so that exposure to dust would be minimized.<br><br>

     After 17 years of research and development, the first CED player (model SFT100W) went on sale on March 22, 1981. A catalog of approximately 50 videodisc titles was released at the same time.The first title to be manufactured was Race for Your Life, Charlie Brown. Fifteen months later, RCA released the SGT200 and SGT250 players, both with stereo sound while the SGT-250 was also the first CED player model to include a wireless remote control. Models with random access hit the market in 1983.
     Several problems doomed the CED system before it was even introduced. From the early development of the CED system, it was clear that VCRs and home videotape—with their longer storage capacity and recording capabilities—posed a threat to the system. However, development pushed ahead. Once released, sales for the CED players were slow. RCA had expected to sell 200,000 players by the beginning of 1982, but only about half that number had been sold, and there was little improvement in sales throughout 1982 and 1983.<br><br>

     The extremely long period of development—caused in part by political turmoil and a great deal of turnover in the high management of RCA—also contributed to the demise of the CED system. RCA had originally slated the videodisc system for a 1977 release. The discs were not able to hold more than 30 minutes of video per side, and the nickel-like material used to make discs was not sturdy enough for manufacture. Signal degradation was an issue, as handling the discs was causing them to deteriorate more rapidly than expected, baffling engineers.<br><br>

     Adding onto the issues was the length of the disks; sixty minutes per disk side rendered it impossible for most movies over 120 minutes to be released on one CED disk. This was easily attainable on VHS and Betamax, as a T-120 VHS, for example (which holds two hours and four minutes of tape), could carry most of these movies. However, this was not the case on CED. Movies like Oklahoma! (1955), Black Sunday, and several James Bond films had to be released on two CED disks. All three of these examples were typically seen on one VHS/Betamax cassette.<br><br>

     RCA had hoped that by 1985 CED players would be in close to 50% of American homes, but the sales of players continued to drop. RCA cut the prices of CED players and offered incentives to consumers such as rebates and free discs, but sales only slightly improved. RCA management realized that the system would never be profitable and announced the discontinuation of production of CED players on April 4, 1984. Remaining stocks of players were sold by dealers and liquidation retailers for as little as $20 each. In an unexpected twist, demand for the videodiscs themselves became high immediately after the announcement, so RCA alerted customers that videodiscs would continue to be produced and new titles released for at least another three years after the discontinuation of players. A few months after this announcement, the sale of discs began to decline, prompting RCA to abandon videodisc production after only two years, in 1986.[15] The last titles released were The Jewel of the Nile by CBS/Fox Video,and Memories of VideoDisc, a commemorative CED given to many RCA employees involved with the CED project, both in 1986.
